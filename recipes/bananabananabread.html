    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (Optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 1/3 cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by heating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Prepare a 9x5-inch bread pan by lightly coating it with grease.</li>
        <li>In a big bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, and a pinch of salt. In a different bowl, use an electric mixer to blend brown sugar and butter until smooth. Mix in the eggs and mashed bananas until it's well combined. Gently fold this banana mixture into the flour mixture, just enough to combine. Then, transfer this batter into your greased pan.</li>
        <li>Bake it in your oven, set to the temperature you preheated to. Check for doneness after about 60 minutes by inserting a toothpick into the center; it should come out clean. After baking, let the bread sit in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it onto a wire rack for complete cooling.</li>
    </ol>
