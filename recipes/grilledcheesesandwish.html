    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A basic grilled cheese sandwich recipe involves simple ingredients and steps. You'll need slices of bread, cheese (like cheddar or American), and butter. First, butter one side of each bread slice. Then, place a slice of bread, butter-side down, in a skillet over medium heat. Lay cheese slices on the bread, and top with the second bread slice, butter-side up. Cook until the first side is golden brown, then flip and cook the other side until brown and the cheese has melted. This simple, classic sandwich is customizable with various cheeses and additional fillings.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>4 slices white bread</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 slices of Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Grill until the bottom is golden, then flip it to cook the other side until the cheese melts. Repeat the process with the remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and cheese slice.</li>
