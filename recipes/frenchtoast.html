    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French toast is a classic and beloved breakfast dish known for its sweet, rich flavor and satisfying texture. It's typically made by soaking slices of bread in a mixture of beaten eggs and milk, then frying them in a pan until golden brown. The outside becomes slightly crispy, while the inside remains soft and moist. Often served with toppings like syrup, powdered sugar, fruit, or butter, French toast offers a versatile and delicious start to the day. This dish can be made with various types of bread and customized with spices like cinnamon or vanilla for added flavor.</p>
