# odin-recipes
Brief Introduction: Applying the HTML I learned via The Odin Project to create a "Odin Recipe" website that links (relative) to other pages that have a specific recipe (My first one, I think?)


Skills I have demonstrated completing this project: Basic HTML I assume and became much more familairized with the process of using Git (clone, add, commit, message guidelines, push, etc) which I expect will help greatly in both individual and collabroative projects
